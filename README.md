Create a database to manage intellectual property assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.

# Intellectual Property Management Database Design

## Executive Summary
This document presents the design of a MongoDB document database for managing intellectual property assets, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The database is intended to provide a structured and efficient system for storing and managing intellectual property information.

## Project Requirements
The database must be capable of:
- Storing information about patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
- Efficiently querying and retrieving intellectual property data.
- Supporting user authentication and authorization.
- Allowing for easy expansion and modification of the database schema.

## Data Model
The database will consist of the following collections:

### Patents
- **_id**: ObjectId (Primary Key)
- title: String
- inventors: Array of Strings
- filing_date: Date
- description: String
- keywords: Array of Strings
- status: String (e.g., pending, granted, rejected)
- related_documents: Array of ObjectIds (References to other documents such as reports or drawings)

### Trademarks
- **_id**: ObjectId (Primary Key)
- mark: String (Trademark name)
- owner: String
- registration_date: Date
- classes: Array of Strings (Trademark classes)

### Users
- **_id**: ObjectId (Primary Key)
- username: String
- email: String
- password: String (hashed)
- role: String (e.g., admin, user)

### Documents
- **_id**: ObjectId (Primary Key)
- title: String
- author: String
- upload_date: Date
- file_path: String
- type: String (e.g., report, drawing, document)

## Conclusion
The designed MongoDB document database provides a comprehensive solution for managing intellectual property assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. It offers flexibility, scalability, and efficient querying capabilities, meeting the project requirements effectively.
